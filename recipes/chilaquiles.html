    <h2 class="header content">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a large (10x15-inch) casserole dish.</li>
        
        <li>Combine drained tomatoes and chipotle chiles in adobo in a blender and puree until smooth.</li>

        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saute onion in hot oil until brown, 5 to 7 minutes.
        Add garlic and saute 1 minute more. Add pureed tomato-chile sauce and simmer until mixture starts to
        thicken. Pour in chicken broth and stir in cumin, oregano, and salt; let simmer until mixture thickens.
        Remove from heat.</li>

        <li>Mix tortilla chips and tomato-chile sauce, folding carefully to cover chips completely. You may have
        to do this in 2 batches.</li>

        <li>Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with half of the chip/sauce mixture. Sprinkle a layer of Mexican
        cheese and cotija cheese over top. Add shredded chicken to cover all of the chips and cheese. Season chicken
        with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with 1/2 of the green onions and 1/2 of the cilantro. Spoon 3/4 of the sour
        cream evenly over top. Spread with the remaining tortilla mixture then top with remaining Mexican and cotija
        cheeses. Cover with aluminum foil.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until mixture is bubbly and cheese is melted, 35 to 45 minutes. Remove from
        the oven and let sit for 5 minutes. Serve with sour cream, green onions, and cilantro.</li>
